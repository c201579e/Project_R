Trump think he is they came to me the   press these people look at all those   cameras back there the press came to me   and they told me that he said would not   pay for the wall do you have a comment I   said yes the wall just got 10 feet   taller   it's true and I love Mexico I love   Mexico I love China I love many of these   countries that rip us off because we   have leaders that are incompetent and   don't know what they're doing I love   these countries they great I have   thousands and thousands of Hispanics   we're going to Nevada I lead I lead with   the Hispanics I'm leading in every poll   with Hispanics they love me I love them   the problem is the problem is that the   leaders of these countries whether it's   Mexico or Japan or Vietnam which is just   doing a big number now all of a sudden   or China in particular that's the big   one the greatest abuse of a country that   I think I've ever seen financially China   what they've done to us is the greatest   single theft in the history of the world   they've taken our jobs they've taken our   money they've taken everything we're   bringing our jobs back folks we're   bringing our jobs back we're going to   bring them back and I know how to do it   we've had so many we've had so many   incredible endorsements and to me   getting the greatest business people to   endorse me as very important Carl Icahn   endorse me so many others have endorsed   me and we're going to put these great   business people in charge of trade and   when China wants to come and negotiate   they're going to negotiate not with a   political hack which is what they have   now they're going to negotiate with the   best business minds in the world and we   have them in this country   so we're going to do a lot of beautiful   work we're going to terminate Obamacare   it's going to be terminated it's going   to be over it's going to be repealed and   it's going to be replaced and you're   going to have much better health care at   a much smaller cost because Obamacare if   you look look at the increases in your   Obamacare 25 35 45 even fifty five   percent it's dead it's not working we're   going to go to a plan that's going to be   so much better and so much less   expensive so second amendment by the way   this is a room loves the Second   Amendment thank you fellas this is a   room loves and cherishes the Second   Amendment we are going to protect our   Second Amendment   [Applause]   common core is gone we are getting rid   of common core we're bringing education   to a local level the people in this   community every time I see them they   want education locally the parents the   teachers they want to do it they don't   want bureaucrats in Washington telling   them how to educate their children we   spend as a nation more for education /   pupal than any other nation in the world   not even close more per pupil second   place doesn't even exist it's so   different and yet out of 30 countries   were ranked number 30 you have China you   have Norway Sweden Denmark and then you   have number 30 the United States so we   spend the most and we're at the bottom   of the heap it's not going to happen   anymore folks not going to happen   anymore we are going to build our   military which I thank because a number   of the people came down in a number of   the pundits and watching tonight we love   our military   we love our military and by the way we   love our police our police are terrific   we love our police they are not being   treated properly we're going to build   our military so big so good so strong so   powerful that nobody is ever going to   mess with us folks and we're going to   buy we're going to buy the equipment   that our generals are soldiers that   everybody that's in the note want we're   not buying equipment that sells because   they have political well because they   take campaign and they give campaign   contributions we are going to get the   equipment that they want not the   equipment that they're told to have by   senators and congressmen in Washington   we're going to have great equipment and   the reason i can say that is I'm   self-funding my campaign I'm not getting   millions of dollars from all of these   I'm not getting millions of dollars from   all of these special interests and   lobbyists and donors that once they get   it they literally do whatever the   politicians want that's not going to   happen and we're going to take care of   our vets we love our vets and they're   being treated terribly with taking care   of our veterans so we're now off to   Nevada and it's a great state we have   great people we have great people in our   nation no matter where we go I went to   Mobile Alabama 35,000 people we went to   Oklahoma recently twice 20,000 people   20,000 people no matter where we go we   fill up the arenas over here the other   day we had a 9,000 we had a 10,000 we   have people the only thing that stops   the crowds are the walls because we   can't get them in we have to send   thousands of people away Time magazine   Time magazine last week did an   incredible comfort cover story they said   it's a movement and that's what it is   it's an incredible movement with   incredible people incredible people   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   it's an incredible movement with   incredible people I tell you and whether   we go honestly whether we go to Dallas   or whether we go anywhere you say you go   to LA you go anywhere you say our people   are incredible and you know our theme   what's our theme you know it right right   our theme which I love maybe the   greatest theme of all time right and the   word again eventually is going to come   off we're going to get rid of the whole   theme because what's going to happen   make America great again right and the   last two weeks because I've gotten to   see so many I guess millions when you   add them all up with all of these rooms   and all of these speeches and I've met   so many people but the people are so   incredible that I've been saying make   America great again and it's going to be   greater than ever before that's the kind   of potential we have greater than ever   before so so so I want to thank   everybody I love you all again South   Carolina we will never forget you we   will never forget you we will never ever   forget South Carolina we will never   forget our great volunteers we love our   volunteers will never forget all of the   people that have helped us so much my   family and folks let's go let's have a
